### REST and Sinatra

**Directions**

Work by yourself or with a partner to describe how we achieve the different CRUD actions in Sinatra. Fill in a chart that outlines which view action (new, create, show, index) each CRUD action is associated with, the type of request (get/post), the URL getting hit, and the code that your controller will call to render the appropriate view:

|CRUD| Action   | Request     | What it does     | URL         | Controller Code       |
|----|-----------|------------|------------------|-------------|-----------------------|
| C  | New       | get        | Displays the form| /users/new  | erb:'users/new.html'  |
| C  | Create    | post       | Makes a user     | /users      | erb: 'users/show.html'|
|    | Show      |            |                  |             |                       |
|    | Index     |            |                  |             |                       |
|    | Edit      |            |                  |             |                       |
|    | Delete    |            |                  |             |                       |
